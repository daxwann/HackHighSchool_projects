  To ensure this evaluation goes smoothly, please respect the following set
  of rules :

  - Please remain courteous, polite, respectful and constructive at all 
    times during this exchange. The trust bond between the school's 
    communauty and yourself depends on it.

  - Should you notice any malfunctions within the submitted project, 
    make sure you take the time to discuss those with the student (or 
    group of students) being graded.

  - Keep in mind that some subjects can be interpreted differently.
    If you come accross a situation where the student you're grading 
    has interpreted the subject differently than you, try and judge
    fairly whether their interpretation is acceptable or not, and grade
    them accordingly. Our peer-evaluation system can only work if you
    both take it seriously.

guidelines_md: |

  - You may only evaluate curriculum checklist on FreeCodeCamp, published 
    website on Github Pages, and the website's source code in the Git 
    submission directory of the student you are grading.

  - Make sure to check wether the GiT submission directory
    belongs to the student (or group) you're grading, and that
    it's the right project.

  - Make sure no mischievous aliases have been used to trick you 
    into correcting something that is not actually in the official
    submitted directory.

  - If the student who is grading this project hasn't done the
    project him/herself yet, he/she must read the whole topic 
    before starting the evaluation session.

  - Use the flags available to you on this scale in order to report
    a submission directory that is empty, non-functional, that contains
    a norm errors or a case of cheating, etc...
    In this case, the evaluation session ends and the final grade is 0
    (or -42, in case of cheating). However, unless the student has
    cheated, we advise you to go through the project together in order 
    for the two (or more) of you to identify the problems that may have 
    led for this project to fail, and avoid repeating those mistakes for
    future projects.
